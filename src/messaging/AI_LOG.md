Updated Plan
  └ ✔ Create messaging module skeleton (constants, error types, mod wiring).
    ✔ Implement minimal Messaging service with component registration and token/permission stubs.
    ✔ Expose API, add basic tests, run fmt/test.

> Added a minimal Messaging module:

  - src/messaging now provides constants, error handling, and a Messaging service registered via the component system.
  - Stubbed request_permission, get_token, and delete_token operations with in-memory token storage, ensuring dependent
  modules can resolve messaging and simulate token usage.
  - Exposed the module through lib.rs and added unit coverage validating token stability and regeneration.

  Formatting/tests: cargo fmt, cargo test (76 tests). Next steps for parity: integrate browser permission APIs, link to
  Installations, implement actual FCM token fetch/delete, service worker support, and client-side message handling.

▌ 

Added src/messaging/README.md summarizing the stubbed messaging module (component wiring, in-memory token helpers)
  and detailing the outstanding work—browser permission flows, real token exchange via Installations/FCM, persistence,
  message handling, full API parity, platform guards, and testing—so the roadmap to full functionality is clear.

> PROMPT: what about the messaging module? (previous prompt was: Now compare the original JS/Typescript files in ./packages/app and the ported files in Rust in ./src/app, and give me an estimated guess, in percentage, of how much of the features/code of the Firebase JS SDK has been ported to Rust)

I'm gathering key points about the messaging module's features and gaps—like the minimal Rust stub missing push and
  service worker support, its limited API implementations, error coverage around 3%, and highlighting relevant JS files
  and paths—so I can create a clear and thorough final summary for the user.

> Coverage is roughly 3 % of the JS Messaging SDK.

  - Rust currently wires a messaging component and exposes request_permission, get_token, and delete_token, but
  everything is in-memory: tokens are random strings keyed by app name, permission always returns true, and deletion
  just clears the map (src/messaging/api.rs:1). Error enums mirror only three codes (src/messaging/error.rs:1). There’s
  no service-worker, push-subscription, or network interaction.
  - The JS module is vast. packages/messaging/src/messaging-service.ts:1 sets up dependencies on Installations,
  Analytics, service workers, BigQuery logging, and background handlers; token APIs drive real browser flows, notice
  packages/messaging/src/api/getToken.ts:1 prompting notification permission, updating VAPID keys, and delegating
  to the token manager. The token manager itself handles IndexedDB persistence, FCM REST calls, weekly refresh, push
  subscription lifecycle, and backend delete/update calls (packages/messaging/src/internals/token-manager.ts:1).
  Surrounding helpers manage service worker registration, environment guards, logging, background/foreground message
  listeners, isSupported checks, delivery metrics export, and testing utilities spread across packages/messaging/src/
  helpers/*, packages/messaging/src/listeners/*, packages/messaging/src/util/*, etc.

  Given the Rust port only reproduces the API shape with a trivial stub while omitting browser integration,
  Installations/Analytics/App Check interop, network requests, persistence, subscription management, message dispatch,
  and emulator/testing support, its functionality today is only a few percent of what the JavaScript SDK provides.
