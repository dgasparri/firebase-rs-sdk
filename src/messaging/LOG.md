Updated Plan
  └ ✔ Create messaging module skeleton (constants, error types, mod wiring).
    ✔ Implement minimal Messaging service with component registration and token/permission stubs.
    ✔ Expose API, add basic tests, run fmt/test.

> Added a minimal Messaging module:

  - src/messaging now provides constants, error handling, and a Messaging service registered via the component system.
  - Stubbed request_permission, get_token, and delete_token operations with in-memory token storage, ensuring dependent
  modules can resolve messaging and simulate token usage.
  - Exposed the module through lib.rs and added unit coverage validating token stability and regeneration.

  Formatting/tests: cargo fmt, cargo test (76 tests). Next steps for parity: integrate browser permission APIs, link to
  Installations, implement actual FCM token fetch/delete, service worker support, and client-side message handling.

▌ 

Added src/messaging/README.md summarizing the stubbed messaging module (component wiring, in-memory token helpers)
  and detailing the outstanding work—browser permission flows, real token exchange via Installations/FCM, persistence,
  message handling, full API parity, platform guards, and testing—so the roadmap to full functionality is clear.
