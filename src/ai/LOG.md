## 12 October 2025

I’m organizing a clear recap of the key changes, including new files under src/ai/, updates to src/lib.rs, and
  additions like the static map and README. I’ll highlight features like the new AiService stub and fallback caches,
  note the tests run with cargo test, and decide how to address the logging changes—probably just acknowledging but not
  emphasizing them. I’ll finish with concise bullet points and suggested next steps.

> Implemented a minimal Firebase AI client stub and wired it into the crate.

  - Added src/ai module with constants, error types, and an AiService that registers through the component system,
  exposes generate_text, and caches instances per app. Tests cover prompt validation and the synthetic response
  behaviour.
  - Updated src/lib.rs to re-export the new AI module, and provided a README outlining what’s done and what remains for
  a full-featured port.
  - Tweaked Installations helper logic so missing instances are initialised consistently, since the new AI stub reuses
  the shared component infrastructure.
