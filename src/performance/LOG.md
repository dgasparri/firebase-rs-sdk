Updated Plan
  └ ✔ Create performance module structure (constants, error types, mod wiring).
    ✔ Implement minimal Performance service with component registration and simple trace/network mark stubs.
    ✔ Expose API, add tests, run fmt/test.

> Added a stubbed Performance Monitoring module.

  - Created src/performance with constants, error types, and a Performance service registered via the component system.
  - Implemented new_trace/TraceHandle::stop to record in-memory traces with metrics and durations, plus inspection via
  recorded_trace.
  - Exposed the module in lib.rs, documented remaining work in src/performance/README.md, and added a unit test.

  Tests: cargo fmt, cargo test (84 passing). Future work includes real backend transport, auto instrumentation, and
  feature parity with the JS SDK.
