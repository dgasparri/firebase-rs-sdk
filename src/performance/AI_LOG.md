Updated Plan
  └ ✔ Create performance module structure (constants, error types, mod wiring).
    ✔ Implement minimal Performance service with component registration and simple trace/network mark stubs.
    ✔ Expose API, add tests, run fmt/test.

> Added a stubbed Performance Monitoring module.

  - Created src/performance with constants, error types, and a Performance service registered via the component system.
  - Implemented new_trace/TraceHandle::stop to record in-memory traces with metrics and durations, plus inspection via
  recorded_trace.
  - Exposed the module in lib.rs, documented remaining work in src/performance/README.md, and added a unit test.

  Tests: cargo fmt, cargo test (84 passing). Future work includes real backend transport, auto instrumentation, and
  feature parity with the JS SDK.

  > PROMPT: Let's focus now on the performance module. Compare the original JS/Typescript files in ./packages/performance and the ported files in Rust in ./src/performance, and give me an estimated guess, in percentage, of how much of the features/code of the Firebase JS SDK has been ported to Rust for this module

  Updated Plan
  └ □ Review README/status documentation for performance module in Rust
    □ Survey JS/TS implementation under ./packages/performance to understand scope
    □ Inspect Rust implementation in ./src/performance and map features
    □ Estimate porting percentage with supporting rationale

  Thinking
  I'm estimating that the Rust stub covers about 3-5% of the full JavaScript features because it only handles manual
  trace storing. The JS version includes extensive instrumentation, API services, and tracing capabilities that the Rust
  code doesn't. I'll explain this and suggest logical next steps based on these differences.

> Port Estimate

  - About 5 % of the JS Performance SDK has a Rust equivalent today. The Rust crate stops at component registration
  plus an in-memory trace stub (src/performance/api.rs:40) and simple error/constants (src/performance/error.rs:4, src/
  performance/constants.rs:1).
  - The JS package delivers full functionality—PerformanceController setup with IndexedDB validation and transport
  bootstrapping (packages/performance/src/controllers/perf.ts:1), API service wiring, installations integration,
  remote-config driven settings, automatic page-load and network instrumentation (packages/performance/src/resources/
  trace.ts:1, packages/performance/src/resources/network_request.ts), session handling, logging, and upload via
  transport_service. None of these surfaces or backends are present in Rust.
  - Advanced trace abilities (attributes, increment metrics, web vitals, OOB routes, user timing hooks) plus sampling,
  error reporting, and console logging provided through services/* and utils/* modules are absent in the Rust stub,
  leaving only manual timing with TraceHandle::stop.
  - Test coverage mirrors this gap: the JS suite spans controllers, resources, services, and utilities, while Rust has
  just one unit test around trace recording (src/performance/api.rs:169).

  1. Next actions: implement a real PerformanceController that wires installations tokens and transport uploads; port
  Trace/NetworkRequest semantics (attributes, metrics, auto instrumentation); add settings/remote-config handling and
  the transport service to move beyond local stubs.
