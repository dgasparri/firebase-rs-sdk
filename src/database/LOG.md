Updated Plan
  └ ✔ Create database module skeleton (constants, error types, mod wiring).
    ✔ Implement minimal Database service with component registration and in-memory set/get/update stubs.
    ✔ Expose API via crate root, add basic tests, run fmt/test.

• Ran git status -sb

> Brought in a stubbed Realtime Database module:

  - Added src/database with constants, error types, and a Database service registered under the shared component system.
  - Implemented DatabaseReference supporting set, update, get, and child on an in-memory JSON tree with basic path
  validation; tests cover write/read and nested updates.
  - Exposed the module via lib.rs and documented next steps in src/database/README.md.

  Also tweaked Installations/Data Connect helpers to cache instances so component lookups succeed in tests. cargo fmt
  and cargo test now pass (83 tests).
