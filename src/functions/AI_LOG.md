Updated Plan
  └ ✔ Create functions module skeleton (constants, error, mod wiring).
    ✔ Implement minimal Functions service with callable stub using reqwest (or placeholder), register component, expose
      API.
    ✔ Add tests, link module in crate root, run fmt/test.

> Minimal Cloud Functions API ported.

  - Added src/functions with constants, error handling, and Functions service registered via the component system.
  - Implemented get_functions (with optional region) and https_callable returning a stubbed callable that round-trips
  serialized data—enough for dependent modules to integrate.
  - Exposed the module in the crate root and added a unit test demonstrating callable usage.

  Formatting/tests: cargo fmt, cargo test (all 75 tests pass). Future work should focus on real HTTPS callable
  invocation (auth, fetch), emulator support, and the richer helpers present in the JS SDK.

  > PROMPT: Do the same analysis for the functions module (previous prompt was: Now compare the original JS/Typescript files in ./packages/app and the ported files in Rust in ./src/app, and give me an estimated guess, in percentage, of how much of the features/code of the Firebase JS SDK has been ported to Rust)

I'm assessing how much the Rust stub covers compared to the full JS implementation. It looks like the Rust side offers
  just minimal structure—component registration and basic stub calls returning the same data—while JS has rich features
  like HTTP calls, streaming, context handling, and multiple dependencies. Based on missing elements like network
  calls, emulator connection, auth tokens, serializers, error mapping, and tests (mostly in packages/functions/src/),
  I estimate coverage around 5%. I'll provide a summary listing the Rust files with implemented features and JS files
  showing missing functionality to clearly present the gaps.

> Estimated coverage is about 5 % of the JS Functions SDK.

  - Present in Rust: component registration and retrieval plus a stub callable wrapper (src/functions/api.rs:1), basic
  error codes (src/functions/error.rs:1), constants (src/functions/constants.rs:1), and the README noting current scope
  (src/functions/README.md:1). Callable functions just echo the payload via JSON roundtrip—no transport or provider
  integration.
  - Missing: the full service implementation that handles fetch transport, auth/app-check/messaging headers, emulator
  wiring, timeouts, retries, and streaming (packages/functions/src/service.ts:1, packages/functions/src/context.ts:1);
  serialization helpers for Firestore types (packages/functions/src/serializer.ts:1); rich error mapping and custom
  details (packages/functions/src/error.ts:1); public API utilities like httpsCallableFromURL, connectFunctionsEmulator,
  and options handling (packages/functions/src/api.ts:1); configuration/emulator detection (packages/functions/src/
  config.ts:1); and the comprehensive test suite (packages/functions/src/callable.test.ts:1, etc.).

  Given that only the API skeleton exists without any network behavior, serialization, or platform integrations, the
  current Rust port covers roughly one-twentieth of the features provided by the JavaScript module.
