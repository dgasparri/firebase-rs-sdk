Added a stubbed Remote Config module plus new Performance and Remote Config services:

  - Remote Config: Component wiring, in-memory defaults/activation, value retrieval, caching, unit tests, and README
  (src/remote_config/*, src/lib.rs).
  - Performance: Component wiring, simple trace recording, tests, README (src/performance/*, src/lib.rs).
  - Updated Installations/Data Connect retrieval to maintain caches and ensure repeated lookups succeed in tests;
  Realtime Database stub added earlier. README files created for analytics, app(-check), auth, messaging, install,
  functions, AI, data_connect, database, performance, remote_config.

> PROMPT: what about remote_configmessaging module? (previous prompt was: Now compare the original JS/Typescript files in ./packages/app and the ported files in Rust in ./src/app, and give me an estimated guess, in percentage, of how much of the features/code of the Firebase JS SDK has been ported to Rust)

Remote Config coverage sits at roughly 3 %.

  - Rust mirrors only the scaffolding: a component registration plus an in-memory RemoteConfig that stores defaults and
  copies them into active values on activate, while fetch is a no-op (src/remote_config/api.rs:1). Errors and constants
  exist, and tests cover default activation only.
  - The JS SDK is far richer, with initialization options, storage caching, network fetch via RemoteConfigFetchClient,
  realtime handlers, settings tweaks, typed getters (getBoolean, getNumber, etc.), custom signals, logging, fetch
  throttling, minimum intervals, persistence with Storage/IndexedDB, and realtime updates (packages/remote-config/src/
  api.ts:1, packages/remote-config/src/remote_config.ts:1, and the accompanying client, storage, value, errors, register
  directories). None of that complexity—networking, caching, realtime listeners, settings—is present in Rust.

  Given the stub retains only the most basic API surface without any real backend interaction, settings, persistence, or
  typed value accessors, the Rust port amounts to about 3 % of the functionality of the JavaScript module.

  > PROMPT: Following the instructions in ./AGENTS.md, read the file ./src/remote_config/README.md and the code in ./packages/
▌ remote_config , what are the next steps and the missing features in the module remote_config and work on the first
▌ step

Thinking
  I’m organizing a clear plan: first, analyze the README and TypeScript code to identify missing features and next
  steps, then update the README with those details. After that, I'll pick a manageable first step—likely implementing
  typed getters or initializing structure in remote_config—to start coding and iteratively improve the module.


Remote Config Updates

  - Reworked src/remote_config/README.md:3 to document current coverage, enumerate remaining JS features, and lay out
  the next actions for the module, in line with the repo guidelines.
  - Added a public RemoteConfigValue helper with typed accessors and source metadata, mirroring the JS Value class (src/
  remote_config/value.rs:6).
  - Expanded the RemoteConfig API with typed getters and a consolidated get_all() map so downstream code can inspect
  values with source awareness (src/remote_config/api.rs:64, src/remote_config/api.rs:96).
  - Ported unit tests that exercise the new value surface and updated stubs to ensure behaviour matches the JS semantics
  (src/remote_config/api.rs:221, src/remote_config/value.rs:114).

  Tests: cargo test remote_config

  Next steps you may want:

  1. Model RemoteConfigSettings (timeout/min fetch interval) and expose a set_config_settings API.
  2. Introduce a storage/cache abstraction to persist active configs and fetch metadata.
  3. Wire up custom signals plus log-level controls ahead of implementing realtime support.
