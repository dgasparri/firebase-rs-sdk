# 12 October 2025

Added a stubbed Remote Config module plus new Performance and Remote Config services:

  - Remote Config: Component wiring, in-memory defaults/activation, value retrieval, caching, unit tests, and README
  (src/remote_config/*, src/lib.rs).
  - Performance: Component wiring, simple trace recording, tests, README (src/performance/*, src/lib.rs).
  - Updated Installations/Data Connect retrieval to maintain caches and ensure repeated lookups succeed in tests;
  Realtime Database stub added earlier. README files created for analytics, app(-check), auth, messaging, install,
  functions, AI, data_connect, database, performance, remote_config.

> PROMPT: what about remote_configmessaging module? (previous prompt was: Now compare the original JS/Typescript files in ./packages/app and the ported files in Rust in ./src/app, and give me an estimated guess, in percentage, of how much of the features/code of the Firebase JS SDK has been ported to Rust)

Remote Config coverage sits at roughly 3 %.

  - Rust mirrors only the scaffolding: a component registration plus an in-memory RemoteConfig that stores defaults and
  copies them into active values on activate, while fetch is a no-op (src/remote_config/api.rs:1). Errors and constants
  exist, and tests cover default activation only.
  - The JS SDK is far richer, with initialization options, storage caching, network fetch via RemoteConfigFetchClient,
  realtime handlers, settings tweaks, typed getters (getBoolean, getNumber, etc.), custom signals, logging, fetch
  throttling, minimum intervals, persistence with Storage/IndexedDB, and realtime updates (packages/remote-config/src/
  api.ts:1, packages/remote-config/src/remote_config.ts:1, and the accompanying client, storage, value, errors, register
  directories). None of that complexity—networking, caching, realtime listeners, settings—is present in Rust.

  Given the stub retains only the most basic API surface without any real backend interaction, settings, persistence, or
  typed value accessors, the Rust port amounts to about 3 % of the functionality of the JavaScript module.

  > PROMPT: Following the instructions in ./AGENTS.md, read the file ./src/remote_config/README.md and the code in ./packages/
▌ remote_config , what are the next steps and the missing features in the module remote_config and work on the first
▌ step

Thinking
  I’m organizing a clear plan: first, analyze the README and TypeScript code to identify missing features and next
  steps, then update the README with those details. After that, I'll pick a manageable first step—likely implementing
  typed getters or initializing structure in remote_config—to start coding and iteratively improve the module.


Remote Config Updates

  - Reworked src/remote_config/README.md:3 to document current coverage, enumerate remaining JS features, and lay out
  the next actions for the module, in line with the repo guidelines.
  - Added a public RemoteConfigValue helper with typed accessors and source metadata, mirroring the JS Value class (src/
  remote_config/value.rs:6).
  - Expanded the RemoteConfig API with typed getters and a consolidated get_all() map so downstream code can inspect
  values with source awareness (src/remote_config/api.rs:64, src/remote_config/api.rs:96).
  - Ported unit tests that exercise the new value surface and updated stubs to ensure behaviour matches the JS semantics
  (src/remote_config/api.rs:221, src/remote_config/value.rs:114).

  Tests: cargo test remote_config

  Next steps you may want:

  1. Model RemoteConfigSettings (timeout/min fetch interval) and expose a set_config_settings API.
  2. Introduce a storage/cache abstraction to persist active configs and fetch metadata.
  3. Wire up custom signals plus log-level controls ahead of implementing realtime support.




 - Added a validated settings surface so callers can inspect and tune fetch behaviour; RemoteConfig::settings and
  set_config_settings now mirror the JS API with rustdoc guidance (src/remote_config/api.rs:52).
  - Introduced RemoteConfigSettings/RemoteConfigSettingsUpdate, default constants, and validation helpers that enforce
  non-zero fetch timeouts while keeping JS semantics for minimum intervals (src/remote_config/settings.rs:8).
  - Expanded module docs to record the new capability and reshaped the completion plan toward storage, transport, and
  realtime work (src/remote_config/README.md:58).

  Tests: cargo test remote_config

  Next steps you may want:

  1. Implement the storage/cache layer that persists active configs, last fetch status, and timestamps.
  2. Design the HTTP fetch client abstraction that honours the new settings and surfaces structured errors.
  3. Layer in custom signals & log-level controls ahead of realtime support.


> PROMPT: all tests passed, proceed with the next steps

Thinking
  I’m planning to implement metadata persistence for fetch operations, so I’ll first check the storage-related files
  in packages/remote-config/src/storage to understand existing structures and requirements before building a simple in-
  memory cache with metadata tracking.

• Explored
  └ List storage
    Read storage_cache.ts, storage.ts


Thinking
  I’m making sure the Debug implementation’s use of active_config() cloning the map is safe despite multiple locks; it's
  acceptable for now. I confirm integration of Arc<dyn RemoteConfigStorage> in the cache and proper trait handling with
  load_from_storage. I’ll update tests, clean imports, adjust the README to mark in-memory persistence as done, note
  yet-to-do durable persistence, format the code, and run relevant tests.

• Ran cargo fmt

  Updating README with metadata note (4m 56s • Esc to interrupt)

I'm reviewing the README intro and doc examples to ensure they compile with the new fetch_time_millis and
  get_remote_config updates. I’m also checking for any dead code warnings around the unused storage methods and plan to
  remove or annotate them accordingly to keep the codebase clean.

• Explored
  └ Search pub fn storage\( in storage.rs

• Ran git status -sb


Thinking
  I'm putting together a clear final message that highlights key additions like the new storage module and fetch
  metadata tracking with precise file and line references. I'll include notes about tests run and add concise next steps
  to wrap it all up neatly.

> Remote Config

  - Wired RemoteConfig through a storage cache so fetches record status, timestamps, and active configs, exposing new
  accessors that mirror the JS properties (src/remote_config/api.rs:35, src/remote_config/api.rs:110, src/remote_config/
  api.rs:132).
  - Added a pluggable storage layer with an in-memory backend and caching semantics equivalent to the JS Storage/
  StorageCache pair, plus unit coverage for state hydration (src/remote_config/storage.rs:13).
  - Updated value lookups and activation logic to flow through the storage cache, keeping remote/default precedence
  consistent with the web SDK (src/remote_config/api.rs:173).
  - Refreshed the module README to document the new metadata support and re-ordered the completion plan around
  transport, durable storage, and realtime follow-ups (src/remote_config/README.md:58).

  Tests: cargo test remote_config

  Next steps:

  1. Design the fetch/transport client so the stub can respect throttling and timeout settings.
  2. Swap the in-memory storage for a persistent backend (e.g., file/IndexedDB analogue) to survive process restarts.

> PROMPT: all tests passed, proceed with the next steps


Thinking
  I’m putting together a clear README update highlighting the new remote config modules, fetch logic, and storage
  changes with precise file references. I’ll also note the tests run with cargo test remote_config and suggest natural
  next steps like implementing a real HTTP fetch client and persistent storage. This summary will help the user see the
  big picture and know what to do next!

> Remote Config

  - Added a pluggable fetch client surface and updated fetch() to respect minimum_fetch_interval_millis, capture
  timestamps/status, and queue fetched templates for activation (src/remote_config/api.rs:125, src/remote_config/
  fetch.rs:11). A helper set_fetch_client allows custom transports while the stub keeps existing behaviour.
  - Activation now promotes fetched templates (and their ETags) into the storage cache so getters report remote/
  default sources just like the JS SDK, and new accessors expose fetch_time_millis/last_fetch_status (src/remote_config/
  api.rs:207, src/remote_config/storage.rs:139).
  - Introduced an in-memory RemoteConfigStorage layer that mirrors the JS StorageCache and refreshed the README
  to document the new metadata coverage and updated roadmap (src/remote_config/storage.rs:13, src/remote_config/
  README.md:58).

  Tests: cargo test remote_config

  Next steps:

  1. Implement an HTTP-backed RemoteConfigFetchClient (reqwest/web-sys) with proper ETag handling and error mapping.
  2. Replace the in-memory storage adapter with a persistent backend and extend durability/warm-up tests.

Thinking
  I’m organizing a final message that highlights key code changes with specific file paths and line numbers, covering
  fetch logic, activation handling, storage traits, and the new HTTP client. I’ll also note the README update, mention
  running tests with cargo test remote_config, and suggest next steps for integrating cross-module functionality and the
  fetch client configuration.

> Remote Config

  - Fetch flow now respects minimum_fetch_interval_millis, forwards the active ETag, records fetch status/
  timestamps, and queues freshly fetched templates for activation (src/remote_config/api.rs:128). The activation
  path promotes the queued config + ETag + template version into storage and exposes the template version through
  active_template_version() (src/remote_config/api.rs:220, src/remote_config/api.rs:267).
  - Storage has been extended with template-version support and helper APIs so caches hydrate and persist the same
  metadata the JS SDK tracks (src/remote_config/storage.rs:44, src/remote_config/storage.rs:139).
  - Added a pluggable fetch layer with a blocking HTTP implementation compatible with the REST API, plus an
  InstallationsProvider hook for supplying installation IDs/tokens (src/remote_config/fetch.rs:70, src/remote_config/
  fetch.rs:86).
  - README now documents the richer metadata handling and updated roadmap for transport/storage work (src/remote_config/
  README.md:58).

  Tests: cargo test remote_config

  Next steps you may want:

  1. Wire HttpRemoteConfigFetchClient into runtime defaults once Installations tokens are available and map backend
  errors/throttle metadata onto public error codes.
  2. Replace the in-memory storage adapter with a persistent backend (filesystem/IndexedDB analogue) and extend tests
  for durability semantics.

▌ Improve documentation in @filename        

> PROMPT: all tests passed. proceed with the next steps

Thinking
  I’m checking that all instances of FetchResponse include the new template_version field to avoid compile errors,
  especially in stubs and tests. I’m also reviewing README changes to ensure the new module paths and imports like
  FileRemoteConfigStorage are correctly reflected, and I’ll finish by running cargo fmt to keep code style consistent.

Thinking
  I'm wrapping up with a summary of the new file storage struct, the with_storage integration, active template
  versioning, and HTTP client additions. I'll also highlight the tests I ran and suggest next steps like connecting HTTP
  default or custom signals for further improvements.

> Remote Config

  - Extended the storage layer with a serializable StorageRecord, added a file-backed FileRemoteConfigStorage, and
  updated the cache to persist template version metadata while providing accessors and tests (src/remote_config/
  storage.rs:1).
  - Introduced RemoteConfig::with_storage so callers can swap the backing store, refreshed fetch to capture template
  versions, and added persistence tests plus an API accessor for the active template version (src/remote_config/
  api.rs:44).
  - Expanded the fetch module with richer request metadata and a blocking HttpRemoteConfigFetchClient that follows the
  REST semantics, including template-version parsing (src/remote_config/fetch.rs:11).
  - Updated the module README to reflect the new storage options and revised roadmap (src/remote_config/README.md:58).

  Tests: cargo test remote_config

  Next steps you may want:

  1. Default Remote Config instances to a real HTTP client by wiring Installations tokens and richer error/throttle
  handling.
  2. Implement platform-specific persistent storage backends (e.g. IndexedDB for wasm/web) and pick sensible defaults
  per target.


> PROMPT: Proceed with the next steps

I’m ready to keep going, but the next tasks depend on how you want to wire the real HTTP transport and platform-
  specific storage:

  - To enable the blocking HttpRemoteConfigFetchClient, I need a source for Installations IDs/tokens. Could you point me
  to (or confirm the shape of) the Installations API we should integrate with, or should I stub a temporary provider?
  - For persistent storage defaults, do you want native builds to opt into the file-backed storage automatically, and
  should we leave wasm targets on the in-memory store until IndexedDB support is implemented?

  Let me know how you’d like those details handled and I’ll continue.

> PROMPT: I think I need more clarifications about the HttpRemoteConfigFetchClient. What are the functions/interfaces that this
▌ class relates to?

> HTTP Fetch Client Context

  - RemoteConfig depends on the RemoteConfigFetchClient trait (src/remote_config/fetch.rs:28); the new
  HttpRemoteConfigFetchClient is one concrete implementation that fulfils this trait when the crate can perform blocking
  HTTP (native builds).
  - FetchRequest/FetchResponse (src/remote_config/fetch.rs:12) describe the data exchanged between RemoteConfig::fetch()
  (src/remote_config/api.rs:128) and any fetch client. The HTTP client consumes FetchRequest (timeout, cache age, ETag,
  custom signals) and produces a FetchResponse (status, config map, ETag, template version).
  - InstallationsProvider (src/remote_config/fetch.rs:70) models the minimal Installations API the HTTP client needs: an
  ID and an auth token. HttpRemoteConfigFetchClient::fetch calls those two methods before making the REST request so it
  can populate the POST body just like the JS RestClient does.
  - HttpRemoteConfigFetchClient (src/remote_config/fetch.rs:86) mirrors the JS RestClient: it builds the v1/projects/
  {project}/namespaces/{namespace}:fetch URL, applies headers (Content-Type, If-None-Match), serializes the request
  body, sends it via reqwest::blocking::Client, and normalizes the response (200 vs 304, template version, “state”
  field) into our FetchResponse.
  - RemoteConfig::set_fetch_client (src/remote_config/api.rs:64) and the RemoteConfig::with_storage constructor allow
  swapping in this HTTP client (or any other RemoteConfigFetchClient implementation) so the higher-level API doesn’t
  change—RemoteConfig::fetch() simply drives the trait.

  In short, RemoteConfig talks to RemoteConfigFetchClient; the HTTP implementation plugs into that trait, relies
  on InstallationsProvider for credentials, and produces the same metadata the rest of the module (storage cache,
  activation) already understands.


> PROMPT: So, if I understood correctly, the source of uncertainty is in the installation module that has not yet be
▌ implemented, right?

Exactly. The fetch client itself is ready, but to actually use it we need a real source for the Firebase Installations
  ID and auth token. The Rust port doesn’t expose that yet, so:

  - InstallationsProvider is just a placeholder trait right now.
  - Until the Installations module (and its API to get ID/token) is ported, we can only drive the HTTP client with a
  stub implementation or leave the default NoopFetchClient in place.

  Once Installations is implemented, wiring it into RemoteConfig will let us instantiate HttpRemoteConfigFetchClient by
  default and have end‑to‑end fetches behave like the JS SDK.

  > PROMPT: Then I prefer to stop developing the remote_config for now and focus on the Installations module. Update the README.md
▌ file so that you will remember where we stopped and the integrations needed

Remote Config README now notes that we’ve paused further work until the Installations module is available; the “Next
  Steps” section explicitly calls out wiring HttpRemoteConfigFetchClient once Installations can supply IDs/tokens.

> In your opinion, what percentage of the remote_config module has been ported now?

> Thinking
  I'm estimating the porting progress at about 25% based on the features done so far—like defaults, fetch stub, storage
  caching, and typed APIs—but noting key parts still missing such as real HTTP wiring, throttling, custom signals,
  logging, and real-time updates. This helps ground expectations on remaining work.

> I’d put the Remote Config port around 25 % complete. We now mirror the JS SDK’s typed getters, settings surface,
  fetch metadata, template version tracking, pluggable storage (memory + file), and even have an HTTP client ready once
  Installations lands. But big pieces remain: wiring that transport by default, throttle/error parity, custom signals,
  logging controls, real persistent storage for web/wasm, and realtime updates. Once the Installations module is in
  place and those integrations are finished, the percentage will jump significantly.
