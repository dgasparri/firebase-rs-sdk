# 14 October 2025

I'm figuring out which files like request.ts and connection.ts are involved in the request stack to model a minimal
  stack that supports future operations. I want to organize this well, probably creating new modules under src/storage/
  impl, and I'll explore the existing JS code to decide what features to port and how to structure it.

  └ Read request.ts, connection.ts, requestinfo.ts, utils.ts, error.rs

> Thinking
  I’m outlining a plan to implement a Rust-based request stack featuring a StorageRequest struct using
  reqwest::blocking::Client, with retry logic via an ExponentialBackoff struct. I’ll mirror TypeScript request patterns
  by creating RequestInfo with builder methods, integrate customizable success and retry codes, and organize modules
  like backoff.rs and request.rs. The goal is a clean, extensible blocking HTTP client with backoff and parsing
  capabilities, plus updating the README to track progress.

• Implemented
  ├ Added `storage::request::{backoff, info, transport}` with exponential backoff, retry evaluation, and a blocking
  │  HTTP client powered by reqwest (`src/storage/request/backoff.rs`, `info.rs`, `transport.rs`).
  ├ Exposed the request module through `storage::mod.rs` and wired convenience constructors on
  │  `FirebaseStorageImpl` to produce operation/upload clients using the configured retry timeouts
  │  (`src/storage/service.rs`:176-185).
  ├ Extended storage utilities with HTTP retry helpers reused by the request stack (`src/storage/util.rs`:1-28).
  ├ Updated the README to reflect the request-layer progress and note remaining work on metadata/serialization
     (`src/storage/README.md`:9-36).
  └ Ported metadata/list parsing plus request builders so `StorageReference::get_metadata`, `update_metadata`, and
     `list` now hit the new transport (`src/storage/metadata/**`, `src/storage/list.rs`, `src/storage/reference.rs`,
     `src/storage/request/builders.rs`).

Ideally next I’ll layer request-info builders for metadata/JSON parsing and start porting specific request types like
`getMetadata` and `list` so higher-level references can consume the new transport.


Thinking
  I'm gathering the key file and line number changes from the new and modified source files to clearly reference them in
  the final summary. I'll also include notes about test runs and documentation updates, then produce a concise wrap-up
  with future implementation hints.

> Request Stack Scaffolding

  - Added a reusable exponential backoff engine plus request descriptors so higher layers can describe Storage HTTP
  calls (src/storage/request/backoff.rs:1-117, src/storage/request/info.rs:11-99).
  - Built a blocking HttpClient wrapper around reqwest that applies jittered retries, honours success/ retry status
  codes, and surfaces structured responses for downstream parsers (src/storage/request/transport.rs:1-176).
  - Exposed the new request module and wired FirebaseStorageImpl helpers to construct operation vs. upload clients using
  the app’s retry settings (src/storage/mod.rs:1-9, src/storage/service.rs:176-185).
  - Extended storage utilities and README to reflect retry-aware behaviour and document the remaining metadata/
  serialization work (src/storage/util.rs:1-28, src/storage/README.md:9-36).

  Tests

  - cargo check
  - cargo test storage::request::backoff::tests::first_delay_is_zero

  Next ideas

  1. Layer metadata/JSON serializers and request-info builders to mirror requestinfo.ts/requests.ts.
  2. Begin porting concrete operations (get_metadata, list) on top of the new transport, including success/error
  parsing.

Thinking
  I’m mapping out tasks to handle metadata and JSON serialization plus request builders. First, I’ll identify key
  TypeScript files like list.ts and metadata.ts, then look into Rust modules such as storage/reference.rs to understand
  how to craft HTTP requests for storage operations. I want to start simple by implementing minimal metadata structures
  and requests to fetch object metadata. Let’s see how the current code handles this!

> Thinking
  I'm planning to integrate request stacks into operations by implementing a metadata type in TypeScript and Rust,
  starting small with a basic FullMetadata or raw JSON mapping. I’ll create a StorageRequest struct wrapping RequestInfo
  and add a send_request method to FirebaseStorageImpl to execute requests via the HTTP client. For now, I’ll focus on
  building a get_metadata_request function that constructs the correct URL and returns metadata as serde_json::Value,
  replicating JS URL-building utilities like makeStorageUrl. This sets the groundwork for smoothly bridging requests
  with future operations.
