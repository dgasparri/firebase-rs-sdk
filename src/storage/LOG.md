# 14 October 2025

I'm figuring out which files like request.ts and connection.ts are involved in the request stack to model a minimal
  stack that supports future operations. I want to organize this well, probably creating new modules under src/storage/
  impl, and I'll explore the existing JS code to decide what features to port and how to structure it.

• Explored
  └ Read request.ts, connection.ts, requestinfo.ts, utils.ts, error.rs

> Thinking
  I’m outlining a plan to implement a Rust-based request stack featuring a StorageRequest struct using
  reqwest::blocking::Client, with retry logic via an ExponentialBackoff struct. I’ll mirror TypeScript request patterns
  by creating RequestInfo with builder methods, integrate customizable success and retry codes, and organize modules
  like backoff.rs and request.rs. The goal is a clean, extensible blocking HTTP client with backoff and parsing
  capabilities, plus updating the README to track progress.

• Implemented
  ├ Added `storage::request::{backoff, info, transport}` with exponential backoff, retry evaluation, and a blocking
  │  HTTP client powered by reqwest (`src/storage/request/backoff.rs`, `info.rs`, `transport.rs`).
  ├ Exposed the request module through `storage::mod.rs` and wired convenience constructors on
  │  `FirebaseStorageImpl` to produce operation/upload clients using the configured retry timeouts
  │  (`src/storage/service.rs`:176-185).
  ├ Extended storage utilities with HTTP retry helpers reused by the request stack (`src/storage/util.rs`:1-28).
  └ Updated the README to reflect the request-layer progress and note remaining work on metadata/serialization
     (`src/storage/README.md`:9-24, 31-36).

Ideally next I’ll layer request-info builders for metadata/JSON parsing and start porting specific request types like
`getMetadata` and `list` so higher-level references can consume the new transport.
