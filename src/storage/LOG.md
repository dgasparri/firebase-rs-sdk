# 12 October 2025

I’m preparing a clear summary of the added Firebase Storage-like module in Rust, detailing file modifications with
  line references and mentioning new dependencies. I’ll note the cargo test execution with warnings from unrelated
  modules and suggest natural next steps like implementing network requests and emulator token integration.

> Added a first-pass Storage port that registers the service, parses bucket locations, and builds typed references in
  Rust.

  - Wired the storage component into the global registry and app containers so callers can resolve instances (including
  per-bucket overrides) via get_storage_for_app and emulator helpers (src/storage/api.rs:15, src/storage/mod.rs:10,
  src/lib.rs:6).
  - Implemented FirebaseStorageImpl with host/bucket state, emulator toggles, and reference construction while keeping
  auth/app-check providers ready for token work (src/storage/service.rs:15).
  - Ported location parsing, path utilities, and reference ergonomics with unit coverage to mirror the TypeScript
  behaviour for gs:// and HTTPS URLs (src/storage/location.rs:7, src/storage/path.rs:1, src/storage/reference.rs:6, src/
  storage/util.rs:1).
  - Added storage-specific error types and re-exported the storage surface; pulled in percent-encoding and url to
  support URL handling (src/storage/error.rs:4, Cargo.toml:15, Cargo.lock).

  Tests: cargo test (passes; still emits pre-existing dead-code warnings from other modules).
 
 
# 14 October 2025

I'm figuring out which files like request.ts and connection.ts are involved in the request stack to model a minimal
  stack that supports future operations. I want to organize this well, probably creating new modules under src/storage/
  impl, and I'll explore the existing JS code to decide what features to port and how to structure it.

• Explored
  └ Read request.ts, connection.ts, requestinfo.ts, utils.ts, error.rs

> Thinking
  I’m outlining a plan to implement a Rust-based request stack featuring a StorageRequest struct using
  reqwest::blocking::Client, with retry logic via an ExponentialBackoff struct. I’ll mirror TypeScript request patterns
  by creating RequestInfo with builder methods, integrate customizable success and retry codes, and organize modules
  like backoff.rs and request.rs. The goal is a clean, extensible blocking HTTP client with backoff and parsing
  capabilities, plus updating the README to track progress.

• Implemented
  ├ Added `storage::request::{backoff, info, transport}` with exponential backoff, retry evaluation, and a blocking
  │  HTTP client powered by reqwest (`src/storage/request/backoff.rs`, `info.rs`, `transport.rs`).
  ├ Exposed the request module through `storage::mod.rs` and wired convenience constructors on
  │  `FirebaseStorageImpl` to produce operation/upload clients using the configured retry timeouts
  │  (`src/storage/service.rs`:176-185).
  ├ Extended storage utilities with HTTP retry helpers reused by the request stack (`src/storage/util.rs`:1-28).
  ├ Updated the README to reflect the request-layer progress and note remaining work on metadata/serialization
     (`src/storage/README.md`:9-36).
  └ Ported metadata/list parsing plus request builders so `StorageReference::get_metadata`, `update_metadata`, and
     `list` now hit the new transport (`src/storage/metadata/**`, `src/storage/list.rs`, `src/storage/reference.rs`,
     `src/storage/request/builders.rs`).

Ideally next I’ll layer request-info builders for metadata/JSON parsing and start porting specific request types like
`getMetadata` and `list` so higher-level references can consume the new transport.


Thinking
  I'm gathering the key file and line number changes from the new and modified source files to clearly reference them in
  the final summary. I'll also include notes about test runs and documentation updates, then produce a concise wrap-up
  with future implementation hints.

> Request Stack Scaffolding

  - Added a reusable exponential backoff engine plus request descriptors so higher layers can describe Storage HTTP
  calls (src/storage/request/backoff.rs:1-117, src/storage/request/info.rs:11-99).
  - Built a blocking HttpClient wrapper around reqwest that applies jittered retries, honours success/ retry status
  codes, and surfaces structured responses for downstream parsers (src/storage/request/transport.rs:1-176).
  - Exposed the new request module and wired FirebaseStorageImpl helpers to construct operation vs. upload clients using
  the app’s retry settings (src/storage/mod.rs:1-9, src/storage/service.rs:176-185).
  - Extended storage utilities and README to reflect retry-aware behaviour and document the remaining metadata/
  serialization work (src/storage/util.rs:1-28, src/storage/README.md:9-36).

  Tests

  - cargo check
  - cargo test storage::request::backoff::tests::first_delay_is_zero

  Next ideas

  1. Layer metadata/JSON serializers and request-info builders to mirror requestinfo.ts/requests.ts.
  2. Begin porting concrete operations (get_metadata, list) on top of the new transport, including success/error
  parsing.

Thinking
  I’m mapping out tasks to handle metadata and JSON serialization plus request builders. First, I’ll identify key
  TypeScript files like list.ts and metadata.ts, then look into Rust modules such as storage/reference.rs to understand
  how to craft HTTP requests for storage operations. I want to start simple by implementing minimal metadata structures
  and requests to fetch object metadata. Let’s see how the current code handles this!

• Explored
  └ Read reference.rs

> Thinking
  I'm planning to integrate request stacks into operations by implementing a metadata type in TypeScript and Rust,
  starting small with a basic FullMetadata or raw JSON mapping. I’ll create a StorageRequest struct wrapping RequestInfo
  and add a send_request method to FirebaseStorageImpl to execute requests via the HTTP client. For now, I’ll focus on
  building a get_metadata_request function that constructs the correct URL and returns metadata as serde_json::Value,
  replicating JS URL-building utilities like makeStorageUrl. This sets the groundwork for smoothly bridging requests
  with future operations.

 Storage Requests

  - Added a full request toolkit (src/storage/request/backoff.rs, info.rs, transport.rs, builders.rs) mirroring the JS
  stack: jittered exponential backoff, rich request descriptors (headers/body/query params), and a blocking HTTP client
  that handles retryable failures.
  - Taught FirebaseStorageImpl to spin up operation/upload clients and execute RequestInfo instances, then wired
  StorageReference to use this infrastructure for get_metadata, update_metadata, and the new list API (src/storage/
  service.rs#L176, src/storage/reference.rs#L60).
  - Ported metadata/list modeling so responses deserialize into typed structures and emit child references (src/storage/
  metadata/mod.rs, src/storage/list.rs).
  - Documented the new surface in the Storage README and log, noting remaining high-level APIs to port (src/storage/
  README.md:9-36, src/storage/LOG.md:6-23).

  Tests

  - cargo check
  - cargo test storage::request::builders::tests::builds_update_metadata_request
  - cargo test storage::request::builders::tests::builds_list_request
  - cargo test storage::list::tests::parses_list_response

  Next ideas

  1. Layer additional request builders (get_bytes, get_download_url) and error mappers so more StorageReference
  operations can go live.
  2. Add high-level helpers (list_all, upload/download metadata flows) and start integrating auth/app-check tokens into
  HttpClient before tackling upload tasks.
