I’m examining how unwrap_or(None) is used on a Result<Option<Arc<T>>, ComponentError> returned by
  get_immediate_with_options and confirming that it safely returns None on error without panicking. I also note the
  need to import serde_json for JSON handling and want to check that initialization logic properly handles fallbacks and
  component availability. Finally, I’ll format the code and run tests to verify everything.

• Ran cargo fmt

• Ran cargo test

> Added a stubbed Data Connect client so other modules can resolve it through the component system.

  - Introduced src/data_connect with constants, basic error types, and a DataConnectService registered under data-
  connect. The service exposes execute on a QueryRequest, returning a synthetic JSON payload that echoes the operation,
  variables, and endpoint.
  - Wired get_data_connect_service to support optional per-endpoint instances and exposed the module via lib.rs.
  - Included unit tests covering successful execution and validation errors; cargo fmt and cargo test now run cleanly
  (81 tests).

  This provides the structural API surface; real transports, schema integration, and error parity remain future work.

> PROMPT: Let's focus now on data_connect module. Compare the original JS/Typescript files in ./packages/data_connect and the ported files in Rust in ./src/data_connect, and give me an estimated guess, in percentage, of how much of the features/code of the Firebase JS SDK has been ported to Rust for this module

Updated Plan
  └ □ Review existing README/documentation for data_connect module to capture current status notes
    □ Survey JS/TS implementation under ./packages/data_connect to understand feature scope
    □ Inspect Rust implementation in ./src/data_connect and compare with JS features
    □ Estimate porting percentage with justification

• Explored
  └ List data_connect
    Read README.md
    List data_connect
    List packages
    List data-connect
    Search find packages/data-connect/src -maxdepth 2 -type f
    Search find src/data_connect -maxdepth 2 -type f
    Read api.rs, constants.rs, error.rs, mod.rs, DataConnect.ts

> Thinking
  I'm considering how much functionality has been ported from JS to Rust and what remains unported. I'll examine key
  modules like QueryManager and Mutation, as well as network handling and watchers, to get a clearer picture of the
  differences and coverage. This way, I can summarize the gap accurately.
