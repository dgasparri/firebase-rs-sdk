I’m examining how unwrap_or(None) is used on a Result<Option<Arc<T>>, ComponentError> returned by
  get_immediate_with_options and confirming that it safely returns None on error without panicking. I also note the
  need to import serde_json for JSON handling and want to check that initialization logic properly handles fallbacks and
  component availability. Finally, I’ll format the code and run tests to verify everything.

• Ran cargo fmt

• Ran cargo test

> Added a stubbed Data Connect client so other modules can resolve it through the component system.

  - Introduced src/data_connect with constants, basic error types, and a DataConnectService registered under data-
  connect. The service exposes execute on a QueryRequest, returning a synthetic JSON payload that echoes the operation,
  variables, and endpoint.
  - Wired get_data_connect_service to support optional per-endpoint instances and exposed the module via lib.rs.
  - Included unit tests covering successful execution and validation errors; cargo fmt and cargo test now run cleanly
  (81 tests).

  This provides the structural API surface; real transports, schema integration, and error parity remain future work.
