Firestore Port Plan

  - Inventory & Mapping: Catalogue packages/firestore entry points (public API surface, component registration,
  platforms) and map each TS module to a Rust target file/module. Note shared dependencies (auth/app/util) to confirm
  existing Rust ports cover them.
  - Define Rust Crate Structure: Sketch the desired src/firestore/ module tree (e.g. api.rs, service.rs, query.rs,
  document.rs, serializer.rs, platform backends). Decide on common utilities that should live in shared crates (util,
  networking, serialization).
  - Translate Core Types: Port public-facing types (Firestore, DocumentReference, Query, CollectionReference, snapshots)
  and value primitives (FieldValue, GeoPoint, Timestamp). Mirror TS interfaces with idiomatic Rust structs/enums.
  - Component Wiring: Register firestore and firestore-internal components against the app container, mirroring the
  JS ComponentType usage. Ensure dependency injection hooks (for auth/app-check) align with existing Rust component
  framework.
  - Networking/Proto Layer: Port the REST/gRPC adapter (api/database fetch logic, serializers) including request queue,
  backoff, and persistence hooks. Decide whether to stub or implement the full persistence layer initially.
  - Operational Logic: Implement querying, document reads/writes, batch/transaction scaffolding—possibly staged (start
  with simple reads/writes before offline/persistence features).
  - Error & Logging Parity: Port error codes/enums, logging categories, and debug instrumentation used across the
  module.
  - Testing Strategy: Replicate unit tests from TS (value conversions, comparator ordering, query building). Add
  integration-style tests once network stubs exist (potentially mocking backends).
  - Documentation & Examples: Add README usage snippets and update crate-level docs to explain the Rust API.
  - Follow-up: After the minimal working surface, iterate on advanced features (bundles, cache, multi-tab persistence)
  once foundational networking and serialization are stable.

> 1. Firestore JS Surface Inventory & Mapping

  - Entry points
      - src/index.ts, index.node.ts, index.rn.ts, plus register.ts wire component registration, version logging, and
  platform-specific exports.
      - src/api/*.ts holds public modular APIs (database bootstrap, refs, queries, transactions, bundles, aggregation,
  field utilities).
      - src/lite-api re-exports a reduced surface that bypasses persistence/offline bits.
  - Core subsystems
      - auth/credentials.ts: credential providers, token helpers.
      - core/*: main client, transactions, query engine, sync engine.
      - local/*: local persistence layers (LRU, multi-tab, bundle cache).
      - remote/*: network stack (datastore, streams, watch/listen, write pipeline) built on gRPC/webchannel.
      - model/*: document/value representations (Document, Mutation, FieldValue, Path, Timestamp, GeoPoint).
      - util/*: shared helpers (async queue, byte strings, debug asserts, error codes).
      - platform/*: browser/node specific glue (component registration, persistence toggles).
      - protos/*: generated typings for Firestore gRPC protos.
  - Tests
      - test/unit/... mirrors each subsystem; lite tests for reduced API; emulator test runners in scripts/.

  High-Level Mapping Idea

  | JS Area | Proposed Rust Target |
  |---------|---------------------|
  | src/index*.ts, register.ts | src/firestore/mod.rs, component.rs, version.rs |
  | api/ | src/firestore/api/ (e.g., database.rs, reference.rs, query.rs, field_value.rs, bundle.rs) |
  | auth/ | Reuse existing auth/app_check providers; add Firestore-specific credential adapters in src/firestore/auth.rs
  |
  | core/ | src/firestore/core/ (firestore_client.rs, transaction.rs, sync_engine.rs) |
  | local/ | src/firestore/local/ (persistence traits, SQLite/IndexedDB stubs) |
  | remote/ | src/firestore/remote/ (datastore, streams, serializer) |
  | model/ | src/firestore/model/ (document.rs, mutation.rs, value.rs, path.rs) |
  | util/ | Extend shared src/util/ when applicable; Firestore-specific helpers live in src/firestore/util.rs |
  | platform/ | src/firestore/platform/ for runtime-specific toggles |
  | protos/ | Replace with Rust protobuf/tonic definitions later (possibly in src/firestore/protos/ or separate crate) |
  | lite-api/ | src/firestore/lite/ re-exporting minimal API |

  2. Proposed Rust Module Skeleton

  src/firestore/
    mod.rs             // top-level exports, component registration
    component.rs       // storage-type constants, provider hookup
    version.rs         // register_version utilities

    api/
      mod.rs
      database.rs      // `get_firestore`, `initializeFirestore`
      reference.rs     // DocumentReference, CollectionReference
      query.rs         // Query, QueryConstraint, orderBy/where builders
      transaction.rs   // Transaction, WriteBatch entry points
      field_value.rs   // FieldValue, FieldPath helpers
      bundle.rs        // LoadBundle API scaffolding
      aggregate.rs     // count/sum/avg wrappers
      settings.rs      // FirestoreSettings, cache config

    auth.rs            // credentials and emulator token wiring

    model/
      mod.rs
      value.rs         // FirestoreValue enum, conversions
      path.rs          // ResourcePath, FieldPath
      document.rs
      mutation.rs
      timestamp.rs
      geopoint.rs
      database_id.rs

    core/
      mod.rs
      firestore_client.rs
      sync_engine.rs
      transaction.rs
      event_manager.rs

    local/
      mod.rs
      persistence.rs   // trait definitions
      memory_persistence.rs (initial stub)
      bundle_cache.rs
      query_cache.rs

    remote/
      mod.rs
      datastore.rs
      stream.rs        // watch/write streams
      serializer.rs    // JSON/Protobuf mapping

    util.rs            // Firestore-specific helpers (AsyncQueue equivalent, ExponentialBackoff reuse?)

    platform/
      mod.rs
      browser.rs       // persistence availability flags
      node.rs          // node-specific credential handling

    lite/
      mod.rs           // re-export subset of api

    protos/
      mod.rs           // placeholder for generated protobuf structs (future)

  - Shared types (timestamps, ByteString) may live in src/util/ if used broadly.
  - Networking & persistence layers can start as stubs returning NotImplemented errors until fully ported.
  - Component registration should mirror existing storage module pattern, adding both public (firestore) and internal
  (firestore-internal) providers once defined.

  Next steps beyond this foundation: prioritize porting the model layer and minimal API (get_firestore,
  DocumentReference path handling) before tackling the heavy core/local/remote logic.






I’m putting together a final message that highlights adding the Firestore module skeleton and re-exports, implementing
  key model types like ResourcePath and DatabaseId with file references, as well as the minimal API with Firestore
  struct and registration. I’ll mention tests for unique app names and storage test tweaks, referencing relevant files
  and lines. I’ll also note calling register_version and register_firestore_component and the use of the unique_settings
  function to avoid duplicates, finishing by pointing out that cargo test and cargo check ran successfully.

> Implemented a foundational Firestore port with minimal API support and refreshed tests.

  - Introduced the Firestore module skeleton with public re-exports and core constants/error wiring so callers can use
  crate::firestore::* (src/firestore/mod.rs:1, src/firestore/constants.rs:1, src/firestore/error.rs:1).
  - Ported key model primitives—ResourcePath, FieldPath, DatabaseId, DocumentKey, Timestamp, and GeoPoint—to mirror the
  JS path/value semantics and added unit tests for each (src/firestore/model/resource_path.rs:1, src/firestore/model/
  field_path.rs:1, src/firestore/model/database_id.rs:1, src/firestore/model/document_key.rs:1, src/firestore/model/
  timestamp.rs:1, src/firestore/model/geo_point.rs:1).
  - Implemented a minimal Firestore API layer: component registration, get_firestore, and typed CollectionReference/
  DocumentReference helpers with auto-ID support and validation (src/firestore/api/database.rs:1, src/firestore/api/
  reference.rs:1). Added pub mod firestore; to the crate root so the surface is available to consumers (src/lib.rs:6).
  - Updated storage tests to give each temporary app a unique name, preventing DuplicateApp collisions now that more
  integration tests run (src/storage/reference.rs:68).

  cargo fmt and cargo test both pass.

Updated Plan
  └ ✔ Port Firestore Value representations (scalar, map, array) and Base64 byte helper with tests.
    ✔ Implement minimal document snapshot and write payload structures leveraging Value types.
    ✔ Add stubbed remote datastore client using reqwest for basic get/set operations.
    ✔ Expose modular API helpers (`get_doc`, `set_doc`, `add_doc`) using datastore stub; update component wiring/tests.
    ✔ Format and run tests to validate.

• Ran git status -sb

> Extended the Firestore port with a usable value layer and a stubbed document API.

  - Added Firestore value primitives (ArrayValue, MapValue, BytesValue, and FirestoreValue) mirroring the JS field
  encodings, including unit coverage (src/firestore/value/*).
  - Introduced minimal document operations: snapshots, set options, validation helpers, and an in-memory Datastore
  that backs a new FirestoreClient with get_doc, set_doc, and add_doc support (src/firestore/api/operations.rs, src/
  firestore/remote/datastore.rs, src/firestore/api/document.rs).
  - Wired the new API surface into firestore::api exports so callers can use FirestoreClient alongside the existing
  references (src/firestore/api/mod.rs, src/firestore/mod.rs).
  - Broadened tests to cover the new value and document paths; all suites continue to pass (cargo test).

  Next steps: 1) expand FirestoreClient beyond the in-memory stub—start porting the real network datastore with request
  serialization; 2) flesh out document snapshots with typed data extraction and integrate with reference API ergonomics.



## 12 October 2025 - second run

I'll wrap up with a final message that references the exact lines added in the README, notes that tests weren't
  run since it's a doc-only change, and offers some logical next steps like verifying dependencies or starting
  implementation tasks. This should keep everything clear and organized!

> Added an actionable roadmap that maps concrete JS sources to their Rust destinations so we can sequence the remaining
  Firestore porting work: see the new “Immediate Porting Focus” table in src/firestore/README.md:47-59. It prioritises
  replacing the stubbed datastore, expanding snapshots/converters, wiring write batches/transactions, and standing up
  the query builder before tackling persistence.

  Tests: not run (doc-only change).

  Next steps: 1) Tackle the P0 datastore row—design the Rust networking layer and identify any shared HTTP/auth
  primitives we need to extract.



  Thinking
  I'll prepare a clear overview highlighting the new HTTP connection and error mapping with precise file and line references, describe the datastore trait restructuring with token provider support,
  document the updated FirestoreClient with new builder methods, mention README improvements, and note the re-export of DocumentSnapshot. I'll also cover test execution results, address the TODO on
  restful set_doc merge support, and suggest next steps focused on real token integration and merge implementation while briefly noting untouched pre-existing log file changes.

• Explored
  └ Read README.md

> Thinking
  I’m outlining a concise summary that highlights key updates: the new HTTP remote stack (connection builder, serializer, error translator, retrying datastore), standardized datastore traits with
  token providers and in-memory impl, FirestoreClient improvements with re-exports and new error codes, plus README updates. I’ll note the set_document merge support is unimplemented and token
  providers default to noop. Tests were run, and next steps include wiring real token providers and implementing merge and watchers.

> Overview

  - Built the network foundation for Firestore: a reusable HTTP connection with emulator awareness (src/firestore/remote/connection.rs:15), Firestore JSON serializer/deserializer (src/firestore/
  remote/serializer.rs:13), RPC->Firestore error mapping (src/firestore/remote/rpc_error.rs:22), and a retrying HttpDatastore that pulls auth/app-check tokens via pluggable providers (src/firestore/
  remote/datastore/http.rs:18).
  - Refactored the datastore layer into a trait plus token-provider abstraction so both the new HTTP client and the existing in-memory store plug in cleanly (src/firestore/remote/datastore/mod.rs:11,
  src/firestore/remote/datastore/in_memory.rs:13); exposed the remote module publicly for consumers (src/firestore/mod.rs:4).
  - Expanded the Firestore error surface so HTTP status translations land on meaningful SDK codes (src/firestore/error.rs:6) and re-exported DocumentSnapshot/SetOptions for crate-wide use (src/
  firestore/api/mod.rs:5); FirestoreClient now accepts any datastore, with helpers for in-memory and HTTP backends (src/firestore/api/document.rs:13,28).
  - Updated Firestore’s README with an immediate porting roadmap plus the revised client constructor using the convenience in-memory backend (src/firestore/README.md:47,82).
  - Note: repository already contained unrelated LOG/JSEXAMPLE changes that remain untouched.

  Tests

  - cargo test

  Next Steps

  1. Wire real auth/app-check token providers into HttpDatastore::builder, and decide how to surface emulator/timeout overrides to callers.
  2. Implement merge/updateMask handling and the remaining write/query RPCs so the HTTP datastore reaches feature parity with the JS client.


   so you are suggesting that now we improve auth and app-check?

> Not necessarily—those next steps were just suggestions if you plan to keep pushing on the networked datastore soon. If you’d rather tackle something else (queries, snapshots, etc.), feel free.
  The current wiring already uses no-op token providers, so it’s safe to leave auth/app-check integration for later unless you specifically need authenticated calls. Let me know what you’d like to
  prioritize next!
